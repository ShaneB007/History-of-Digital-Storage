## History of Computer Digital Storage
### Shane Bishop

The purpose of this tutorial is to educate students on the evolution of digital storage, including some of the latest technologies developing today. Storage is an important part of most digital devices, and having a good base of knowledge is important for IT students. While it won't be completly compreshinsive, it will give students a good history of the technology and its most used formats.

This tutorial is focused towards IT students looking to expand their knowledge of general computer history and current technologies.

#### Tape Drives
In 1928 Fritz Pfleumer, a German engineer, invented the tape drive, a device that used reels of magnetic tape to store information within them. Tape drives are still used today, mostly as long term storage because it can safley be stored for many years, while also being fairly cheap. Tape drive's main weakness is the slow rate that information can be read off of the tape, which is another reason it is favored for long term storage.

#### Hard Disk Drive (HDD)
Uses one or many roating platters coated with a magnetic material, along with a magnetic head placed on a acuater arm that is used to read and write on the platters, also known as disks. This technology was developed by IBM in 1956, and quickly dominated the market as the pimary source for computer storage. The technology was realitvly cheap to produce, and allowed for massive amounts of data to be stored. HDD's continue to be used in the computer industry to this day, and the technology has improved in both read/write speeds, reliabilty, and maximum storage size. The hard disk drive wasn't perfect however, as it was quite heavy, the mechanical parts within them could easily wear out or break, and movement could cause damage, and potential data loss.

#### Floppy Disk
Invented in 1967 by IBM, Floppy Disks served as mobile storage data that worked off of smilar technologies as Hard Disk Drives

## History of Computer Digital Storage
### Shane Bishop

The purpose of this tutorial is to educate students on the evolution of digital storage, including some of the latest technologies developing today. Storage is an important part of most digital devices, and having a good base of knowledge is important for IT students. While it won't be completely comprehensive, it will give students a good history of the technology and its most used formats.

This tutorial is focused towards IT students looking to expand their knowledge of general computer history and current technologies.

#### Tape Drives

In 1928 Fritz Pfleumer, a German engineer, invented the tape drive, a device that used reels of magnetic tape to store information within them. Tape drives served as one of the first technologies to use a magnetic material as long term data storage, and this idea served as the backbone for later computer storage advancements. Tape drives are still used today, mostly as long term storage because it can safely be stored for many years, while also being fairly cheap. Tape drive's main weakness is the slow rate that information can be read off of the tape, which is another reason it is favored for long term storage.

#### Hard Disk Drive (HDD)

Uses one or many rotating platters coated with a magnetic material, along with a magnetic head placed on a actuator arm that is used to read and write on the platters, also known as disks. This technology was developed by IBM in 1956, and quickly dominated the market as the primary source for computer storage. The technology was relatively cheap to produce, and allowed for massive amounts of data to be stored. HDD's continue to be used in the computer industry to this day, and the technology has improved in both read/write speeds, reliability, and maximum storage size. The hard disk drive wasn't perfect however, as it was quite heavy, the mechanical parts within them could easily wear out or break, and movement could cause damage, and potential data loss.

#### Floppy Disk

Invented in 1967 by IBM, Floppy Disks served as mobile storage data that worked off of similar technologies as Hard Disk Drives to store data, with the main difference being portability. At the time the project wasn't considered to be overly important, but it quickly took off as the defacto form of portable digital data. At first they were just naked mylon disks that would be put into a drive, and read from, but it was quickly found that the design was easily damaged. Then they developed a plastic sleeve for the disks, as well as a self contained cleaning technology, that further improved the reliability of the disks. The biggest effect of floppy drives on the computing world, was the ability to share software between users, whereas before most users had to create their own software, even word processors. The floppy disk was an important factor for computers entering a more widespread use in business, as well as consumer use in homes.

#### Compact Disk (CD)

The compact disk started as a joint venture between Sony and Phillips in 1979, and was being built to replace vinyl as the new popular format for music storage. Data is stored on CD using an optical transparent foil and then using a high powered laser to read information etched into the foil. CD's quickly passed vinyl as the go to format for listening to music, and before long they were also used as data storage under the format of CD-ROM. CD-ROM's replaced floppy disks both in the business world and consumer use, due to their ability to store more data, and cheap production costs.

#### Flash Memory & Solid State Drives (SSD)

Flash memory uses non-volatile NAND memory to store data, and unlike hard drive disks, have no moving parts. Flash memory saw its first large scale consumer use with flash drives, also known as zip drives, for small scale mobile transport of digital data. Since flash memory has no moving parts, it could easily be moved around without fear of it breaking or losing data, while also being very small. Eventually SSDs were produced as an alternative to hard disk drives, with the advantages of faster read/write speeds, no moving parts, and a smaller and lighter form factor. Most SSDs use DRAM, a form of volatile memory to store their data, which means they must hold a constant charge in order to keep data stored. SSDs store that data, and can hold a charge for up to 2 years without being powered, but will eventually lose the data. For this reason, SSDs are not usually used for long term storage. Early on SSDs were very expensive compared to HDDs and also generally offered smaller storage sizes, which caused a slow adoption, even though their smaller size and faster speeds gave them a clear advantage. Over time prices have dropped, and SSDs have begun to replace HDDs for most uses within computers. Speeds are being pushed even further than traditional SSDs with NVMe drives, that use PCI express ports for read/write speeds up to 5 times faster than a traditional SSD.
